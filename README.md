# Is There a Good Life? Why Ephemeral Pleasures Make Us Less

## The Nature of Death

Death renders everything both meaningless and yet meaningful by the end of a person's life. 

The purpose of this essay is to think about success and death. Death seems to be the less popular word of the two. Why this is so, mightn't seem so obvious. We can speculate it owes to some inclining of uncertainty which might be associated to the word death. 

To wallow in an eternal darkness requires us to first assume there is an end to the living we are consistently experiencing. This of course is seen when we witness the death of others, but it is far from experienced. When we see someone die, we observe the cessation of their movement, their breathing, their responses - but we cannot truly know what they experience in that transition, if anything at all. 

To assume our own becoming into a lifeless corpse will remain speculation till our ultimate demise. This uncertainty persists because we can only know death from the outside, never from within. If we accept that our senses might deceive us - that what we perceive might not reflect ultimate reality - then even our observations of death in others become questionable. We see bodies cease to function, but can we truly know that consciousness ends? 

This fundamental uncertainty about our own mortality shapes how we approach life itself. Nonetheless, a plausible answer does not assume. Life therefore, is continuous, and nothingness is unimaginable. Success is far more interesting, it is fun, it is all the talk. But the way we might define success is philosophically troublesome.

## The Problem of Success

A thinker of these ideas spends more time in deep contemplation than accumulating material wealth. Success in this case is suffering, much like the burn muscles feel approaching a marathon finish line. This too, if a habit, can become almost addictive and confused with pleasure. If the mind only experiences pain, it's probably all it can remember, and slowly confuses pain with happiness. 

Happiness similarly is often confused with pleasure, though the feeling of achievement after running the marathon is not the same as indulging in decadent chocolate. What firmly distinguishes the two is selfishness. Devouring a rich dessert is more selfish than running a marathon. In the one case our body begs us to quit as we get closer to the end, and in the other our body doesn't want us to stop as we get close to the end. 

If we are to consider feeling as a valid epistemological input, then we can conclude there is a higher degree of biologically instilled "want" associated to indulging in sweet treats. However, want, is often popularized as a foundational principle behind all success. Perhaps the most popular saying is, "find something you want to do". 

The problem lies in the vague sentiment of want. But we must distinguish between different forms of possession. A prince inherits a throne - he simply has it, without striving. A beggar who dreams of kingship knows only the wanting to have, the yearning for what lies beyond reach.

If we examine what each values as success, we see the difference clearly. The prince, born to power, may find success in wisdom or virtue or even in giving his throne away. He can transcend possession because he never knew its absence. But the beggar defines success as the very thing he lacks - the crown, the wealth, the recognition. His want shapes his entire vision of what matters.

This reveals the trap: when we lack something, we imagine that having it would complete us. Want creates its own mythology, convincing us that success means obtaining what we desire. But those who already possess what others crave often discover its emptiness. The question then becomes: can we see beyond our wants to what truly matters, or are we forever prisoners of what we lack?

## Death and Free Will

Death exists, and so free will cannot. The inevitable cannot be rationalized or argued out of an equation which has an answer. The answer being there exists biological function and a rendering of the human body. The general argument for free will is along the lines, "I do what I want when I want". But biologically we will always be overcome by sleep no matter how much we might want to stay awake, or by hunger when our body demands sustenance.

However, let us assume free will exists in the selection of a food item. But here the taste of food is a biological response. If we are inclined to say, well it is not in the taste but in the ability to select and choose the food item. The question now concerns the placement of the item within the environment. It will also be found the biology of a person here too informs what a person feels like eating. A person might further argue, "no, but I can fight these urges and choose what I want." 

It is this fight which is of particular interest now and must be distinguished from want by connecting it to will. It will be found will power is not linked to feeding our urges, no, quite the opposite. Will power often becomes stronger when we go against our own desires.

## On Goodness and Love

Different people have different ideas of God. From the religious priest, to the young child. A scientist might envision an equilibrium, while a young child might envision a bearded man. Therefore, it becomes pointless to debate the nature of God. It is better to focus on the nature of goodness.

It will be found without much debate, to love your neighbor more than you love yourself is good. It is good by all means as serving myself serves no purpose, other than the entropic purpose of rendering down by the frictions of my own desire, whereas loving another person more than I love myself contributes to society and its progression. By giving up all it is that I desire, I can only find discipline. I am able to step toward something which is brighter, through the recognition much like Socrates that my life is rather nothing. 
 
From the village man of time to a great philosopher, through to the average person, there is something deterministic about life. Its rendering, free will can always be argued but what cannot be argued against is determinism, as we are all fated to die. And if this is such a certainty then why must we argue, collect riches, if we are of course all subject to this entropy?

Only the human spirit can conquer the grave through the degradation of want and the engagement in love for another to form selflessness and courage. From the wellspring of loving one another, comes peace and strength to the heart. If all which is to be lost is that which is to be given. If the heart wants what it does not understand, then to be set free is to let go of that which is what we think we want to have, only to make way toward a destination where we will find what has already been made available to us.

To arrive at this is to find the life which we will not live, is to find that which is the life of the other which one does not desire. It is the life of another which is love of life, as we are all connected in spirit. We exist as individual consciousness, yet through genuine love and connection with others, we transcend our isolated existence. This togetherness is not mere proximity but a deeper unity achieved through love, life, and passion, not the kind that enslaves us to our own fleeting wants.

## The Nature of Truth and Good

People will find what is bad is subjective and what good is too. The goal then is to find something we can agree on to be true. And what is true must also be good. There is little to no doubt the following axiom holds to be true: If I give more to every and any person around me, then I am contributing to the greater whole of society.

Is there any success behind this, a person might ask? Not in any contemporary understanding. This service, by following this principle, I contribute to society, and find a purpose much greater than myself. Is this truth though? The question requires deeper examination. Actually, you cannot imagine nothing to exist. If you define nothing as an absence of everythingness, then assume in the beginning there was primordial nothing. Then this nothing is a continuum of a something of a nothing, which eventually means you still end up with something. 

Ok now, how do you imagine this something of a nothing to look like? Why are you imagining something black? Black is merely the absence of light. Nothing would be more transparent wouldn't it? As there is no light to cast a shadow. It's not easy to imagine something we have not experienced before, or perhaps it is not even possible to do so.

## What Makes Life Worth Living

In this life we do not have to decide what information is right or wrong, nor do we have to decide what is to live for. All we have to decide is what is worth dying for. And nothing can be more true than living for dying while trying to bring about good. But what is good? Of course it is not something which can be had but it can be experienced by giving. But giving what, they might ask? Giving an invention, an idea, not making money for its own sake.

What makes us human is not rationality. The mind, which can calculate with such precision that two plus two equals four, applies this same mechanics to our wants. When I desire to avoid conflict, I find reasons to lye to another person to protect their feelings. When I crave another drink, logic provides, one more won't hurt, tomorrow I'll abstain. 

But notice how we construct justifications as sturdy as mathematical proofs. Yet two plus two equals four only shows an understanding of logic - it can serve truth when within reason, or deception swhen twisted to our purposes. These justifications become logical tools we employ to shield ourselves from discomfort. When we lie to "spare feelings," we avoid the virtue of honesty and the growth it brings both to the speaker and to the listener. 

Truth-telling requires courage to face another's pain and our own vulnerability. Our rationality hasn't assisted us in bringing to light the truth; it has become want's advocate, dressing cowardice as kindness, indulgence as deserved reward. No, what separates us from animal is virtue, which is the choice to align our actions with truth regardless of comfort, to use our logic in service of integrity rather than desire.

Truth-telling brings forth another consideration. When harsh truth is spoken to us, when words cut deep, the wound creates its own test. We feel the rise of anger, the mind racing to defend, to counter-attack. But in this very moment there comes another opportunity to arrive at the virtue of patience. To hear what pains us and yet remain still, to let the sting pass without striking back, this requires something beyond both instinct and cleverness. In patience, we must hold to what is good even when wounded. Letting go of anger requires understanding that truth, however painful, serves something greater than our comfort.

What endures? We might measure success by how long something is remembered after we are gone. Yet wealth dissipates, fame fades, even charitable acts are forgotten. History remembers not the richest Romans but their philosophers and poets. This suggests success lies elsewhere - in the permanence of ideas rather than the accumulation of things.

If the soul is the written word, then what we create outlives the body that created it. Words on a page remain when the hand that wrote them has turned to dust. Ideas leap from mind to mind across centuries. In this way, writing becomes a form of immortality - not of the flesh, but of thought itself.

Consider the implications: If death is final nothingness, then perhaps it would make sense to pursue only immediate pleasures, to lie and cheat for comfort. But something drives the scholar to preserve ancient texts, the teacher to pass on knowledge, the writer to labor over words few may read. This dedication to something beyond personal gain - call it truth, call it goodness, call it the divine - reveals our deepest nature. We act as if ideas matter eternally, as if truth has value beyond our brief existence.

How do we know good from evil? Watch a child learning to ride a bicycle. When you see the wheel wobble, you could rush to steady it. But wisdom often means standing back, allowing the small falls that teach balance, intervening only when real harm threatens. Good and evil reveal themselves in such moments - in knowing when to act and when to refrain, when to speak truth and when to remain silent.

## The Ethics of Small Actions

Why pick up a bottle on the side of the road? The immediate answer reveals itself in layers. First, there is the simple physical act - bending down engages muscles, provides a moment of exercise, grounds us in the present through bodily movement. But this personal benefit merely scratches the surface of a deeper truth.

The bottle removed makes life easier for another person - perhaps a parent pushing a stroller, an elderly person with uncertain footing, or simply someone who finds beauty diminished by litter. Yet even this consideration for others points to something more profound. When we act from love of others rather than ourselves, we participate in creating the very world we wish to inhabit.

This is the paradox of selfless action: by loving others more than ourselves, we craft a society that ultimately benefits us all. If everyone picked up bottles, cleaned common spaces, held doors - these small acts would weave a fabric of mutual care that wraps around each of us. The exercise we gain from bending down becomes secondary to the exercise of will over indifference. The clean path we create for others becomes the path we ourselves will walk.

Thus we see how benefiting broader society inherently benefits us, not merely through physical exercise or cleaner streets, but through the cultivation of a world shaped by consideration rather than neglect. We cannot say picking up every bottle is always right. But we can say that such acts, performed with genuine care for others, build both better societies and better selves.

## Loving Above All Things

But then the question becomes what does it mean to love something above all things? I think the answer to this question is not straight forward, as all things include those things which are tangible and exist. Therefore, it has to be something of extreme good, or at least something which is in the form of extreme good in something.  

And here we arrive at the crux of sanctimony. To live sanctimoniously is to perform virtue rather than embody it, to display moral behavior as a facade while harboring different intentions beneath. They give not from abundance but from calculation. In this way, sanctimony becomes the very ephemeral pleasure it claims to transcend. The fleeting satisfaction of being seen as good replaces the lasting fulfillment of being good.

Consider the marathon runner again. If he runs for the medal, for the photograph, for the accolades, then his suffering becomes meaningless the moment the crowd disperses. But if he runs to conquer himself, to prove that will can overcome want, then each step builds something eternal within him. The sanctimonious life mistakes the appearance of virtue for virtue itself, trading the eternal for the ephemeral.

What then of ephemeral pleasures? They are not evil in themselves, no more than hunger or sleep. They simply are. The error lies in mistaking them for the whole of existence. A life spent chasing indulgences, wealth, or recognition is like trying to fill a sieve with water. Each pleasure passes through, leaving only the hollow vessel and the bitter taste of a fulfillment that does not last.

The truly worthwhile life, paradoxically, may appear less successful by conventional measures. The philosopher hunched over his desk, the mother caring for her child, the person who picks up the bottle when no one is watching - these acts build no monuments visible to the eye. Yet they construct something far more enduring: a character that death cannot unmake.

## The Final Choice

In the end, we must choose. Do we live for the applause of others, wearing sanctimony like a crown while secretly indulging every ephemeral whim? Or do we accept that to love others more than ourselves, to give without thought of return, to suffer for something greater than our own pleasure - this is the only success that matters when we face that final certainty?

Death makes philosophers of us all, eventually. The question is whether we will have spent our lives building sandcastles or cathedrals. The sanctimonious build elaborate sandcastles, beautiful to behold but dissolved by the first wave. Those who sacrifice ephemeral pleasures not for show but for love, they build with stone. Their works may be humbler, less noticed, but they endure.

And perhaps that is the ultimate irony: in seeking to appear virtuous through sanctimony, we achieve neither virtue nor lasting pleasure. But in genuinely sacrificing ephemeral pleasures for the good of others, we find something that transcends both - a life that, though it must end, points beyond its own ending to something eternal.

The sanctimonious life, built on ephemeral pleasures disguised as virtue, makes us less because it reduces us to performers in our own moral theater. True fulfillment comes not from the appearance of goodness but from its practice, not from the pursuit of pleasure but from the cultivation of will over want, not from having but from giving, not from being seen but from seeing others and loving them more than ourselves.
